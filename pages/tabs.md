Tablature (also called "tabs") for the ukulele is a way of writing down finger picking directions. Tablature is also used for the guitar and other fretted instruments.

In tabs, four horizontal lines represent the ukulele strings. The G string is at the bottom, and the A string is at the top. To indicate which fret should be held with the left hand for a note, the fret number is written on the appropriate string's line. 

When you are supposed to play multiple notes at the same time, either as a strum or simultaneous plucking, the fret numbers are written stacked together vertically. For example, the most common C major chord would be written in tabs like this:

![Simultaneous notes](../assets/scores/tab1.svg)

That diagram means you would hold the A string on the 3rd fret and the other three strings are played "open" without holding them at any frets.

When you are supposed to play the notes for a C major chord consecutively, it would be written like this:
