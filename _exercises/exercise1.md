There are 12 total notes: A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, and G#/Ab. When you move from one note to the next adjacent note in that series, it's called a *half step*. If you skip over the adjacent note onto the next one, it's called a *whole step*. Each fret on your ukulele is a half step in pitch from the previous fret. If you play the C string without holding a fret, that is a C note. If you play the C string on the 1st fret, that is a C# or Db note. If you move up a fret on the C string to the 2nd fret, that is a D note.
