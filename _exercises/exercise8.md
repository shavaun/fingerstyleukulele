*Eighth notes* last for one half of a quarter note, which means you can play two eighth notes in the same length of time as you'd play one quarter note. When there is a single eighth note, it is drawn like a quarter note but with a little wavy flag on its stem. When it is adjacent to other eighth notes, the stems are connected into a horizontal line.<br><br>They are fast, but it is important to maintain control and to not just pluck as fast as you can. Start this exercise at 40 BPM and do not increase the tempo until you have control of the rhythm.
