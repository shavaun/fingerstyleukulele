## Practice directions

1. Review the exercise, including the note durations.
2. Play through the exercise at the starting tempo, which you can find at the top left of each exercise. Replay it at that tempo (or slower, if necessary) until you are able to play it smoothly and comfortably.
3. Repeat step 2, increasing the tempo by 10 BPM each time until you reach {% if page.peak_tempo %}{{ page.peak_tempo }} BPM{% else %} the peak tempo{% endif %}.
