A *chord* is a collection of notes (usually 3 notes) that are played at the same time or consecutively. When you play the notes of a chord consecutively, it's called an *arpeggio*.<br><br>

Most music is written with chords in mind, regardless of whether your right hand is finger picking or strumming. In this exercise we play the C Major chord, which is made of the notes C, E, and G. Try to minimize the movement of your left hand by keeping the 3rd fret of the C string held down throughout the exercise.
