When you think of the children's song Mary Had a Little Lamb, you probably think of the *melody* of that song. Someone could play other notes along with the melody, but you'd still recognize it. The melody does not have to be sung like it typically is with Mary Had a Little Lamb, it can also be played by an instrument.<br><br>*Harmony* is what we call the other notes that someone could play, such as chords or embellishments. These add depth to support the melody and make it fuller. On the ukulele, you can play the melody and the harmony at the same time which is called a *chord melody* arrangement.<br><br>The *melody* in this arrangement of Mary Had a Little Lamb is colored in red. Remember to keep your right hand fingers assigned to individual strings.
