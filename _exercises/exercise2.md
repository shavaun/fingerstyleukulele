You may have noticed that we skipped frets in the previous exercise. That's because on the ukulele each fret is a *half step* increase in pitch, and the C major scale only contains 7 out of 12 possible notes. When we encounter one of the excluded notes that isn't part of the C major scale, we have to skip over a fret. The only pairs of notes that don't have an extra note between them are E and F, and B and C. When you play the C major scale on a single string, the pattern of skipping frets is more obvious.<br><br>Tip: If you feel like the ukulele is going to fall when you move your hand further down the fretboard, make sure that you are holding the ukulele body steady with your right arm.
