In traditional music notation, music is divided into *measures*. Each measure lasts a specific length of time and is an important part of the rhythm. At the beginning of the composition, the *Time signature* tells you two pieces of information:

- The top number of the time signature indicates how many beats fit into a measure.
- The bottom number of the time signature indicates which type of note is equivalent to a beat.

For example, *4/4* time (also known as "common time") means that there are 4 beats in a measure, and that a beat is a quarter (4th) note. The next most frequently-used time signature is *3/4*, which means that there are 3 beats in a measure, but that a beat is still a quarter note. 

The style of each note indicates its duration. At the top right of each exercise you can find all of the note types that are in the exercise and their duration.
