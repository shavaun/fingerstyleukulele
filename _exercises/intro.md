These exercises are designed to help you practice fingerstyle ukulele skills. Start at the first exercise and learn them in order.

You do *not* need to know how to read traditional music notation, but the exercises are also provided in that format.

## You will need:

- An ukulele. The exercises are written assuming a high G tuning, but you can use a low G or even baritone tuning if you want, just be aware that the tablature fingering and traditional notation will no longer match each other so you will have to pick one or the other to follow.
- A metronome. You can use an app on your phone, a physical metronome, or a [website](https://www.flutetunes.com/metronome/). You can even use Youtube videos that have preset tempos.
