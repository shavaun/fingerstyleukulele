A *chord* is a collection of notes (usually 3 notes) that are played at the same time or consecutively. When you play the notes of a chord consecutively, it's called an *arpeggio*.<br><br>

Most music is written with chords in mind, so whether you are finger picking or strumming with your right hand, your left hand will be moving between chords. In this exercise, we use two chords:<br>
<ul><li>C major - Start with your left hand holding the A string on the 3rd fret.</li>
    <li>G major - At the 5th measure, move your left hand fingers to hold the A string on the 2nd fret, the E string on the 3rd fret, and the C string on the 2nd fret.</li>
</ul>
