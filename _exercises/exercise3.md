A *key* is a collection of notes where each note is included based on a predefined pattern. A *scale* is an arrangement of notes when you put them in ascending or descending order.<br><br>The lowest note in a key is called the *tonic* or *root* note. In a *Major* key the notes are selected based on this formula: Root, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, and half step back to the root. Remember, a half step takes you to the adjacent note, and a whole step skips over the adjacent note. Therefore, the key of C contains the notes C, (skip C#), D, (skip D#), E, F, (skip F#), G, (skip G#), A, (skip A#), and B. This exercise ascends through the C major scale and then descends back to C.
