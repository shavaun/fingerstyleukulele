The fret for a particular note is going to be different depending on which string you play it on. For example, in this exercise we play a G note on the C string, 7th fret, and on the E string, 3rd fret. That's because a G note is 7 half steps higher in pitch from a C (starting on C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G), but only 3 half steps up from an E (starting on E, F, F#, G).
